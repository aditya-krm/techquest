# Building My Blog Site with Next.js, TypeScript, and Next API: The Journey

## Introduction

Creating a blog platform has always been a goal of mine, and with the amazing tools available today, I decided to embark on the journey of building my own. In this post, I'll walk you through how I built my personal blog site using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Next API**.

## Why I Chose Next.js and TypeScript

With the web development landscape constantly evolving, choosing the right tech stack was crucial. I wanted a solution that was not only powerful but also scalable and easy to maintain. That's where **Next.js** and **TypeScript** came in.

### Next.js

Next.js offers server-side rendering, file-based routing, and the flexibility of both static and dynamic content generation. It has built-in features like API routes, which make it an ideal choice for a blog that needs speed and reliability.

### TypeScript

I've been using JavaScript for years, but TypeScript brings static typing to the language, helping me catch potential bugs during development. This improved type safety has increased my productivity and made my codebase easier to manage.

## Setting Up the Project

When I started, I knew I wanted a simple and fast way to get my blog up and running. Here’s a quick overview of my project structure:

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI
- **Content Editor**: I used `@uiw/react-md-editor` for writing and formatting blog content.

## Building the Backend with Next API

For the backend, I leveraged Next.js API routes, which allowed me to create a simple yet powerful API to handle blog posts, quizzes, and more. It made sense to keep everything within the Next.js ecosystem for a smooth development process.

### Features I Implemented:

- **Dynamic Blog Rendering**: I fetch and display blog posts from a backend source.
- **Content Creation**: I used Markdown for creating and editing blog content.
- **Dark Mode**: Since I’m a big fan of dark mode, the entire site is styled accordingly.

## Challenges I Faced

Like any project, this one came with its challenges. One major hurdle was managing **npm** and dependencies while setting up the project. Thankfully, **nvm** came to the rescue, allowing me to switch between Node.js versions with ease.

Another challenge was structuring the content efficiently for the blog while ensuring optimal performance, especially with server-side rendering. However, by using Next.js's built-in optimizations, I was able to achieve a smooth user experience.

## What’s Next?

This blog is just the beginning! I have big plans for it—expanding into quizzes, interview preparation, and more. I'll continue sharing my experiences, tips, and projects to help others in their development journey.

Stay tuned for more technical deep dives, project breakdowns, and everything related to full-stack development!

## Conclusion

Building this blog site was a fantastic learning experience. I’m excited to use it as a platform to share my knowledge and projects with the world.
